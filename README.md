# Frontline

Frontline is an open-source project focused on enhancing the capabilities of the option chain code. This project serves as a skeleton for further developments and integrations.

## Description

Frontline is designed to be a foundational codebase for advanced option chain analysis and data handling. It currently offers a streamlined way to fetch and display option chain data. 

### Future Features

Planned upgrades and features for Frontline include:

1. **Data Storage**: Implementing functionality to save data in SQL and XLS formats.
2. **Automated Data Fetching**: Setting up a system to automatically fetch and save data at 3-minute intervals, with an additional 20-second gap to ensure the data is updated from the API endpoints.
3. **Scheduling and Cron Jobs**: Integration of cron jobs to efficiently manage data fetching, including considerations for holidays and non-trading days.
